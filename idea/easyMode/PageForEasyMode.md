# Share your page idea for Easy mode

The page should be something well known by most
But not Super easy to find either
feel free to add your language as a new file in lang folder as *LangPrefixOnWiki.md*

exemple: for english the wikipedia prefix is en which lead to en.wikipedia.org so the file is named en.md
